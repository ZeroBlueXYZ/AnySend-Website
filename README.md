## Translation

Help add more languages to make FileDirect avaiable to a wider audience.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Add new locale in `src/i18n` by copying the English locale file `en.json` and renaming it to the target locale. Check [locale codes](https://saimana.com/list-of-country-locale-code/) for a full list of locales.
3. Translate the English content to the target language.
4. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) to propose your changes.

More, help translate the [app](https://github.com/ZeroBlueXYZ/FileDirect) as well.
